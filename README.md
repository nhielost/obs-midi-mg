# obs-midi-mg

Allows MIDI devices to interact with OBS Studio.

### This plugin will not work in OBS Studio versions below 28.0.0 due to its usage of Qt 6, meaning that any users using an OS below Windows 10 or MacOS 10.15 will not be able to use this plugin.
(This may be addressed at a later date.)

## Credits

I have to give a shoutout to [@cpyarger](https://github.com/cpyarger) and [@Alzy](https://github.com/alzy) for the inspiration of this plugin. Many ideas found in obs-midi-mg can be found in their plugin. Without [obs-midi](https://github.com/cpyarger/obs-midi/), obs-midi-mg would have never been possible.
